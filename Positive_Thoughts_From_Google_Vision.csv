NAVAL'S LAWS
The below is Naval's response to the question ""Are there any quotes you live by
or think of often?"" These are gold. Take the time necessary to digest them.
""These aren't all quotes from others. Many are maxims that I've carved for
myself.""
+ Be present above all else.
» Desire is suffering (Buddha).
→ Anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at
someone else (Buddhist saying).
If you can't see yourself working with someone for life, don't work with
them for a day.
- Reading (learning) is the ultimate meta-skill and can be traded for any-
thing else.
» All the real benefits in life come from compound interest.
» Earn with your mind, not your time.
» 99% of all effort is wasted.
» Total honesty at all times. It's almost always possible to be honest and
positive.
- Praise specifically, criticize generally (Warren Buffett).
- Truth is that which has predictive power.
→ Watch every thought. (Always ask, ""Why am I having this thought?"")
> All greatness comes from suffering.
> Love is given, not received.
> Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts (Eckhart Tolle).
> Mathematics is the language of nature.
> Every moment has to be complete in and of itself

"If there's empty spaces in your heart,
They'll make you think it's wrong,
Like having empty spaces,
Means you never can be strong,
But I've learnt that all these spaces,
Means there's room enough to grow,
And the people that once filled them,
Were always meant to be let go,
And all these empty spaces,
Create a strange sort of pull,
That attract so many people,
You wouldn't meet if they were full,
So if you're made of empty spaces,
Don't ever think it's wrong,
Because maybe they're just empty,
Until the right person comes along.

"A small hint comes from interesting research about how people thrive. In
one shocking experiment, researchers found that senior citizens who didn't
feel useful to others were nearly three times as likely to die prematurely as
those who did feel useful. This speaks to a broader human truth: We all
need to be needed.
Being “needed"" does not entail selfish pride or unhealthy attachment to the
worldly esteem of others. Rather, it consists of a natural human hunger to
serve our fellow men and women. As the 13th-century Buddhist sages
taught, ""If one lights a fire for others, it will also brighten one's own way.""

Tibetan bowls are set with seven metals, and emulate the sounds of nature.
The sound of the Tibetan Bowls is in accordance with the Golden Ratio. They are tuned according to the Pythagorean scale.
The sound of the Tibetan Bowls and their harmonics serve to balance the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual planes.
The Tibetan bowls have been created with conscience and intention and are used as guides in ceremonial rites, astral travel,
the awakening of consciousness, activate or balance the fields and in the cure of diseases.
The great experts in sound therapy have already discovered scientifically that through sound you can achieve

prison for us, restricting us to our personal

Friday Morning is a love song, written and recorded at the remote farm in Burton, Texas where Khruangbin got its start. To commemorate the song, the band asked their
closest friends and family to record messages of love to each band member. The music video is a portrait of the band hearing these audio recordings for the first time,
capturing on film the emotions one feels when they hear just how loved they are; a poignant and heartfelt expression in a time where, as a collective whole, we need to
hear and express love more than ever.

"Some sociologists have gone as far as to suggest that we are

of mass society, human nature is best suited to small, caring
groups. The anthropologist Robin Dunbar at the University of
Oxford claims that humans can comfortably maintain no more
than 150 stable relationships, which suggests that
communitarian living might not be so much of an 'outlier' or
'experiment'. From an evolutionary perspective, modern
society itself might be the anomaly. As the cultural critic Daniel

"IF THERE'S EMPTY SPACES IN YOUR HEART,

WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE LET G0.
AND ALL THESE EMPTY SPACES,
CREATE A STRANGE SORT OF PULL,

DON'T EVER THINK IT'S WRONG,

"When did you know you were rich?
I really knew I was rich when I had $10,000. I knew along time ago that I was going to be doing something I loved doing
with people that I loved doing it with. In 1958, I had my dad take me out of the will, as I knew I would be rich anyway. I let
my two sisters have all the estate.
I bet we all in this room live about the same. We eat about the same and sleep about the same. We pretty much drive a car
for 10 years. All this stuff doesn't make it any different. I will watch the Super Bowl on a big screen television just like you.
We are living the same life. I have two luxuries: I get to do what I want to do every day and I get to travel a lot faster than
you.
You should do the job you love whether or not you are getting paid for it. Do the job you love. Know that the money will
follow. I travel distances better than you do. The plane is nicer. But that is about the only thing that I do a whole lot
different.
I didn't know my salary when I went to work for Graham until I got his first paycheck. Do what you love and don't even
think about the money. I will take a trip on Paul Allen's Octopus ($400M yacht), but wouldn't want one for myself. A 60
man crew is needed. They could be stealing, sleeping with each other, etc. Professional sports teams are a hassle,
especially when you have as much money as him. Fans would complain that you aren't spending enough when the team
loses.
If there is a place that is warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and you do what you love doing, you will do fine.
You're rich if you are working around people you like. You will make money if you are energetic and intelligent. This
society lets smart people with drive earn a very good living. You will be no exception.

"The term ""amor fati"" (lat. for love of fate or love of
one's fate) is a concept popularized by German
philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. It can be described
as an ""uncompromising acceptance of reality per
se"", a state of mind in which one sees everything
that happens in one's life, including suffering and
loss, as good or at least necessary, in that they are
among the facts of one's life and existence. They
are always necessarily there whether one likes them
or not.
Nietzsche himself put it like that: ""I want to learn
more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary
in things; then I shall be one of those who makes
things beautiful. Amor fati""

"IF
BY RUDYARD KIPLING
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt
you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
you can dream-and not make dreams your master;
If you can think-and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And which is more you'll be a Man, my son!

amazement and there's awe. It's largely a function of literacy that someone, because of their natural
capacities, but more often because of their environmental encouragement or discouragements
along the way, believes the world is properly apprehended through one of those kinds of awes-the

"So if what I really desire are meaningful relationships and connections, ideas that deeply
challenge and transform who I am, and meaningful ways to influence people, where then
should I look?
Probably in the eyes of friends after a late night on the porch, rather than twitter. Probably in
the pages of an old and influential book, rather than the latest addition to Wikipedia or
YouTube. Probably more in the silence and experience of this beautiful, fragile, mysterious life,
rather than the vapid distractions of modern technology. And also, perhaps, in places modern
technology would least likely lead me to expect.

"Maslow's self-actualizing characteristics
• Efficient perceptions of reality. Self-actualizers are able to judge situations correctly and honestly. They are very sensitive to the fake and dishonest, and are free
to see reality 'as it is'.
• Comfortable acceptance of self, others and nature. Self-actualizers accept their own human nature with all its flaws. The shortcomings of others and the
contradictions of the human condition are accepted with humor and tolerance.
• Reliant on own experiences and judgement. Independent, not reliant on culture and environment to form opinions and views.
Spontaneous and natural. True to oneself, rather than being how others want.
• Task centering. Most of Maslow's subjects had a mission to fulfill in life or some task or problem 'beyond' themselves (instead of outside of themselves) to
pursue. Humanitarians such as Albert Schweitzer are considered to have possessed this quality.citation needed
• Autonomy. Self-actualizers are free from reliance on external authorities or other people. They tend to be resourceful and independent.
• Continued freshness of appreciation. The self-actualizer seems to constantly renew appreciation of life's basic goods. A sunset or a flower will be experienced as
intensely time after time as it was at first. There is an ""innocence of vision"", like that of an artist or child.
• Profound interpersonal relationships. The interpersonal relationships of self-actualizers are marked by deep loving bonds.
• Comfort with solitude. Despite their satisfying relationships with others, self-actualizing people value solitude and are comfortable being alone.19]
• Non-hostile sense of humor. This refers to the ability to laugh at oneself.
• Peak experiences. All of Maslow's subjects reported the frequent occurrence of peak experiences (temporary moments of self-actualization). These occasions
were marked by feelings of ecstasy, harmony, and deep meaning. Self-actualizers reported feeling at one with the universe, stronger and calmer than ever
before, filled with light, beauty, goodness, and so forth.
• Socially compassionate. Possessing humanity.
• Few friends. Few close intimate friends rather than many superficial relationships.201

Billy Joel. He did an interview on 60 minutes and among other thingsvhe said that made so
much sense he said 1 thing that more or less changed my perception of life enabling me to
resolve something I had been pondering. I can't remember word for word but something to
the effect. When he was asked if he was ""happy"" he said happiness is an ideal state of mind
that he doesn't strive for because it is inherently unsustainable. Instead he strives for
contentment. Contentment is sustainable allowing happy, although fleeting, being content
is the obvious starting point. I didn't really like his music but had to admit his lyrics made
allot of sense. After hearing that it occurred to me that I had been blindly chasing an ideal
that, at best, only happens occasionally and realized I should start counting the every day

"+ Here's a quote l'm thinking about ""Therefore we should not try
to alter circumstances but to adapt ourselves to them as they really
are, just as sailors do. They don't try to change the winds or the sea
but ensure that they are always ready to adapt themselves to
conditions. In a flat calm they use the oars; with a following breeze
they hoist full sail; in a head wind they shorten sail or heave to. Adapt
yourself to circumstances in the same way."" – Bion of Borysthenes

"Figures as different as Charles Dickens, Henri Poincaré, and Ingmar Bergman, working in disparate
fields in different times, all shared a passion for their work, a terrific ambition to succeed, and an
almost superhuman capacity to focus. Yet when you look closely at their daily lives, they only spent a
few hours a day doing what we would recognize as their most important work. The rest of the time,
they were hiking mountains, taking naps, going on walks with friends, or just sitting and thinking.
Their creativity and productivity, in other words, were not the result of endless hours of toil. Their
towering creative achievements result from modest ""working"" hours.

"66 It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out
how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man
who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust
and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who
comes short again and again, because there is no effort
without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive
to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great
devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at
the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring
greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and
timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

"Eternalism (philosophy of time)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Eternalism is a philosophical approach to the ontological nature of time, which takes the view that all points in time are equally real, as opposed to the presentist idea that only the present is real, and the
growing block universe theory of time in which past and present are real while the future is not. Eternalism is the view that each spacetime moment exists in and of itself. Modern advocates often take inspiration
from the way time is modeled as a dimension in the theory of relativity, giving time a similar ontology to that of space. This would mean that time is just another dimension, that future events are ""already there"",
and that there is no objective flow of time. It is sometimes referred to as the ""block time"" or ""block universe"" theory due to its description of space-time as an unchanging four-dimensional ""block"", 12 as
opposed to the view of the world as a three-dimensional space modulated by the passage of time.

When a man no longer
confuses himself with the
definition of himself that
others have given him, he is
at once universal and unique.
He is universal by virtue of
the inseparability of his
organism from the cosmos.
He is unique in that he is just
this organism and not any
stereotype of role, class, or
identity assumed for the
convenience of social
communication.

what's going on is more a chaotic scramble for advantage than a
rational trade in resources.
No matter how cunning the algorithms and filters, entire industries of
manufactured attention bloom and fade around every possibility of
profit. As recent investigations have suggested, achievements in the
field range from 'click farms' of low-paid workers churning out ersatz
engagement to paid endorsements from social media celebrities, via
bulk-purchased followers and fake grassroots activists. Every target is
continually being moved, refined and undermined. Nobody is in

"The next element of happiness you need to master is imagination.
I wrote about this in the context of raising your energy, which is
closely related to happiness, but it bears repeating in this chapter. Pes-
simism is often a failure of inmagination. If you can imagine the future
being brighter, it lifts your energy and gooses the chemistry in your
body that produces a sensation of happiness. If you can't even imag-
ine an improved future, you won't be happy no matter how well your
life is going right now.
I find it useful to daydream that the future will be better than to-
day, by far. I like to imagine a future that is spectacular and breath-

ourselves first, in all our glory and our
