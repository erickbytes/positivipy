myself.""
+ Be present above all else.
» Desire is suffering (Buddha).
→ Anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at
someone else (Buddhist saying).
If you can't see yourself working with someone for life, don't work with
them for a day.
- Reading (learning) is the ultimate meta-skill and can be traded for any-
thing else.
» All the real benefits in life come from compound interest.
» Earn with your mind, not your time.
» 99% of all effort is wasted.
» Total honesty at all times. It's almost always possible to be honest and
positive.
- Praise specifically, criticize generally (Warren Buffett).
- Truth is that which has predictive power.
→ Watch every thought. (Always ask, ""Why am I having this thought?"")
> All greatness comes from suffering.

They'll make you think it's wrong,
Like having empty spaces,
Means you never can be strong,
But I've learnt that all these spaces,
Means there's room enough to grow,
And the people that once filled them,
Were always meant to be let go,
And all these empty spaces,
Create a strange sort of pull,
That attract so many people,
You wouldn't meet if they were full,
So if you're made of empty spaces,
Don't ever think it's wrong,
Because maybe they're just empty,
Until the right person comes along.

Tibetan bowls are set with seven metals, and emulate the sounds of nature.
The sound of the Tibetan Bowls is in accordance with the Golden Ratio. They are tuned according to the Pythagorean scale.
The sound of the Tibetan Bowls and their harmonics serve to balance the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual planes.
The Tibetan bowls have been created with conscience and intention and are used as guides in ceremonial rites, astral travel,
the awakening of consciousness, activate or balance the fields and in the cure of diseases.

BY RUDYARD KIPLING
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt
you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
you can dream-and not make dreams your master;
If you can think-and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And which is more you'll be a Man, my son!","if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too; if you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies, or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: you can dream, and not make dreams your master; if you can think",If by rudyard kipling

375,"Maslow's self-actualizing characteristics
• Efficient perceptions of reality. Self-actualizers are able to judge situations correctly and honestly. They are very sensitive to the fake and dishonest, and are free
to see reality 'as it is'.
• Comfortable acceptance of self, others and nature. Self-actualizers accept their own human nature with all its flaws. The shortcomings of others and the
contradictions of the human condition are accepted with humor and tolerance.
• Reliant on own experiences and judgement. Independent, not reliant on culture and environment to form opinions and views.
Spontaneous and natural. True to oneself, rather than being how others want.
• Task centering. Most of Maslow's subjects had a mission to fulfill in life or some task or problem 'beyond' themselves (instead of outside of themselves) to
pursue. Humanitarians such as Albert Schweitzer are considered to have possessed this quality.citation needed
• Autonomy. Self-actualizers are free from reliance on external authorities or other people. They tend to be resourceful and independent.
• Continued freshness of appreciation. The self-actualizer seems to constantly renew appreciation of life's basic goods. A sunset or a flower will be experienced as
intensely time after time as it was at first. There is an ""innocence of vision"", like that of an artist or child.
• Profound interpersonal relationships. The interpersonal relationships of self-actualizers are marked by deep loving bonds.
• Comfort with solitude. Despite their satisfying relationships with others, self-actualizing people value solitude and are comfortable being alone.19]
• Non-hostile sense of humor. This refers to the ability to laugh at oneself.
• Peak experiences. All of Maslow's subjects reported the frequent occurrence of peak experiences (temporary moments of self-actualization). These occasions
were marked by feelings of ecstasy, harmony, and deep meaning. Self-actualizers reported feeling at one with the universe, stronger and calmer than ever
before, filled with light, beauty, goodness, and so forth.
• Socially compassionate. Possessing humanity.
• Few friends. Few close intimate friends rather than many superficial relationships.201",,actualizing characteristics efficient perceptions of reality. self

Mechelle Bennett, I like bugs.
Answered Jan 15, 2016
Billy Joel. He did an interview on 60 minutes and among other thingsvhe said that made so
much sense he said 1 thing that more or less changed my perception of life enabling me to
resolve something I had been pondering. I can't remember word for word but something to
the effect. When he was asked if he was ""happy"" he said happiness is an ideal state of mind
that he doesn't strive for because it is inherently unsustainable. Instead he strives for
contentment. Contentment is sustainable allowing happy, although fleeting, being content
is the obvious starting point. I didn't really like his music but had to admit his lyrics made
allot of sense. After hearing that it occurred to me that I had been blindly chasing an ideal
that, at best, only happens occasionally and realized I should start counting the every day
blessings.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Eternalism is a philosophical approach to the ontological nature of time, which takes the view that all points in time are equally real, as opposed to the presentist idea that only the present is real, and the
growing block universe theory of time in which past and present are real while the future is not. Eternalism is the view that each spacetime moment exists in and of itself. Modern advocates often take inspiration
from the way time is modeled as a dimension in the theory of relativity, giving time a similar ontology to that of space. This would mean that time is just another dimension, that future events are ""already there"",
and that there is no objective flow of time. It is sometimes referred to as the ""block time"" or ""block universe"" theory due to its description of space-time as an unchanging four-dimensional ""block"", 12 as

“There are two basic motivating forces:
fear and love. When we are afraid, we
pull back from life. When we are in
love, we open to all that life has to
offer with passion, excitement, and
acceptance. We need to learn to love
ourselves first, in all our glory and our
imperfections. If we cannot love
ourselves, we cannot fully open to our
ability to love others or our potential
to create. Evolution and all hopes for a
better world rest in the fearlessness and
