       "\"Climb mountains not so the world can see you, but so you can see the world. Your life is a series of moments i now. the better you make your now the better your life.. What defines us is how well we rise after falling.. One today is worth two tomorrows; what i am to be, i am now becoming.. Your mind is a garden your thoughts are the seeds you can grow flowers or you can grow weeds. A river cuts through rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence.. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was ... consider again that dot. that's here, that's home, that's us. ... lived out their lives..

Stop living life for what's around the corner and start enjoying the walk down the street.. If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try. Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light. Yes, i did it! i will do it can do it i'll try to do it how do i do it? want to do it i can't do it won't do it which step have you reached today?.

Education is learning what you didn't even know you didn't know.. You can achieve anything you want. How people treat you is their karma; how you react is yours.. What we are what we want to be leap of faith make the jump.. I don't think of work as work and play as play. it's all living.. It is only courage on the path itself that makes the path appear. Rejection is inevitable. let it hit you hard for a moment, feel the hurt, and then move on.. Take risks now and do something bold. you won't regret it.. Even the darkest night wil end and the sun will rise. If you feel passionate about something in your soul, continue to pursue it. pursue it with all the love you have.. Why be negative when you can be positive. Your mind is a powerful thing. when you fill it with positive thoughts, your life will start to change.. You will need: curiosity, kindness, stamina, a willing ness to look stupid. Every day. become a better coder. become a better musician. become a better cook. be a morning person. be healthy. be present. be grateful. seek to understand seek to connect.

Imagine if our daily habits could change our world. guess what? they can. the everyday lifestyle choices we can all make for happier coexistence and a healthier planet.. This is my simple religion. there is no need for temples, no need for complicated philosophy. our own brain, our own heart is our temple. the philosophy is kindness.. What is the end of human life? it is not, believe me, the chief end of man that he should make a fortune and beget children whose end is likewise to make a fortune, but it is, in few words, that he should explore himself. The aim of life is to live, and to live means to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware.. When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.. Be present above all else. desire is suffering buddha. anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at someone else buddhist saying. if you can't see yourself working with someone for life, don't work with them for a day. reading learning is the ultimate meta. A mistake repeated more than once is a decision..

When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive, to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.. The main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning. if you knew when you began a book what you would say at the end, do you think that you would have the courage to write it? what is true for writing and for love is also true for life. the game is worthwhile insofar as we do not know what will be the end.. Take counsel from your courage, nof your fear.. If there's empty spaces in your heart, they'll make you think it's wrong, like having empty spaces, means you never can be strong, but i've learnt that all these spaces, means there's room enough to grow, and the people that once filled them, were always meant to be let go, and all these empty spaces, create a strange sort of pull, that attract so many people, you wouldn't meet if they were full, so if you're made of empty spaces, don't ever think it's wrong, because maybe they're just empty, until the right person comes along.. Try repeat learn grow the circle of life. Think positive, & positive things will happen. Why do anything? process, man, process. it is not the destination. it never is. it is the journey. it always is.. A small hint comes from interesting research about how people thrive. in one shocking experiment, researchers found that senior citizens who didn't feel useful to others were nearly three times as likely to die prematurely as those who did feel useful. this speaks to a broader human truth: we all need to be needed. being needed does not entail selfish pride or unhealthy attachment to the worldly esteem of others. rather, it consists of a natural human hunger to serve our fellow men and women. as the 13th century buddhist sages taught, if one lights a fire for others, it will also brighten one's own way.. Three secrets to daily joy and lasting fulfilment: try to be happy today whilst looking forward to achieving your dreams. the secrets to daily joy: do your best to dedicate time to activities that can make you happy in the present and lasting fulfillment and in the future. don't wait for everything to fall in place before you take your stab at happiness..

Dare to err and to dream. deep meaning often lies in childish plays.. Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.. Someday the chicago cubs are going to be in the world series. For the free man, all he has is merely an instrument for greater aliveness; it does not matter whether he has more or less, because he is himself! everybody is able to have the same experience. if he can attain a state of mind in which he is not preoccupied with anything, still, concentrated, not holding on to anything, he will experience unusual strength and vitality if he turns to something he feels like doing. out of this stillness he acquires the energy for action but only for essential action ie action that corresponds to his essence as man.. Your future is whatever you make it, so make ita good one.. Think big and don't listen to people who tell you it can't be done. life is too short to think small..

Your handwriting. the way you walk. which china pattern you choose. it's all giving you away. everything you do shows your hand. everything is a self-portrait. everything is a diary.. All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.. When the otherwise incessant flow of our distracting thoughts is calmed through concentrating on the breath, our mind becomes unusually lucid and clear. we should stay with this state of mental calm for a while.

The flower doesn't dream of the bee. it blossoms and the bee comes.. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. you feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. see, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other... God grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the the things i can and wisdom to know the difference. Travel the world. Evolution we are survivors of immeasurable events, flung upon some reach of land, small, wet miracles without instructions, only the imperative of change.. Play is the highest form of research. As you walk down the fairway of life you must smell the roses, for you only get to play one round.. Largeness is a lifelong matter. you grow because you are not content not to. you are like a beaver that chews constantly because if it doesn't, it's teeth grow long and lock. you grow because you are a grower; you're large because you can't stand to be small..

Life is like a piano. the white keys are happy days, and the black keys are sad ones. just remember that you need both to make music..
