The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day..

We eat about the same and sleep about the same. We pretty much drive a car for 10 years. All this stuff doesn't make it any different. I will watch the super bowl on a big screen television just like you. We are living the same life.

Be led by your dreams.. When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive. To breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.. what if i pick the choices wrong thing and then i'm heading in the wrong direction? But really, deciding where to start is the enemy of starting. Start.

So, we can choose either to approach our fellow human beings with suspicion or to approach them with an open mind, a dash of optimism and a great deal of candour.. Human beings are funny... They long to be with people they love, but refuse to admit it openly. Some are afraid to show even the slightest sign of affection because of fear that their feelngs may not be recognized, or even worse, returned. But one thing abut human beings that puzzles me the most is their conscious effort to be connected to the object of their affection even if it kills them slowly within.. .

In Schopenhauer's words, man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wills, accompany me in all situations throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others, even if they are rather painful to me. This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper.. amor fati: latin for love of fate or love of one's fate is a concept popularized by german philosopher friedrich nietzsche. It can be described as an uncompromising acceptance of reality per se, a state of mind in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including suffering and loss, as good or at least necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence.

Eternalism philosophy of time from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia eternalism is a philosophical approach to the ontological nature of time, which takes the view that all points in time are equally real, as opposed to the presentist idea that only the present is real, and the growing block universe theory of time in which past and present are real while the future is not. Eternalism is the view that each spacetime moment exists in and of itself. Modern advocates often take inspiration from the way time is modeled as a dimension in the theory of relativity, giving time a similar ontology to that of space. This would mean that time is just another dimension, that future events are already there, and that there is no objective flow of time. It is sometimes referred to as the block time or block universe theory due to its description of space-time as an unchanging four.
